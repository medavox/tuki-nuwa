Although I have some formal education (and a lot more self-teaching) in linguistics,
I find that some of the traditional terms for certain linguistic concepts are confusing,
hide their meaning, and increase cognitive load.

For this reason, in constructing this language I have used a mix of terms from orthodox linguistic practice 
(when I consider the term to be sufficiently transparent),
and more colloquial, or even invented terms -- as long as they are sufficiently transparent.

For instance, I think calling it the complete tense is much clearer than calling it the perfect tense.

It is my intention to be consistent with usage; i.e. if I use an orthodox Linguistic term somewhere,
I will use that term everywhere. Conversely, if I use a different label than the orthodox Linguistic one for a concept,
I will use that altered label everywhere.

The goal is to ease understanding.

I Minored in Linguistics during my degree in Computer Science.
The Minor comprised one third of the teaching & credits in my first year.

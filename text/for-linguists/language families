this list will probably be a little insulting to everyone:

either your language

1. has been rudely lumped together with others
who speak a completely different language,

2. hasn't been mentioned at all (the cheek!),

when everyone knows there's only one proper way to speak your language,
and I'm giving all those other wrong versions too much credit

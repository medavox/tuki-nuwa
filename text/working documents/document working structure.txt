for each part of the language,
have a document that is official (for external use), 
and a document discussing possible additions (for me:  like a wiki's talk page)

the parts of the language:

alphabet, sounds & pronunciation (basically done)
dictionary/word list
general grammar of the language
grammar for specific words & constructions
repair strategies (how to pronounce a foreign word with foreign sounds)
conceptual metaphors used
vocab sets (subsets of the main dictionary)
    body parts
    days of the week
    months, seasons
    numbers
    elements
    names of letters (ay bee see etc)

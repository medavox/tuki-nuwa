Grammar Discussion
=======

This document is intended to serve as a grammar counterpart to the new-words document;
a landing-place for new ideas to possibly realise in tuki nuwa,
and a sort of checklist of things we still need to do

Branching
=========

We need to explicitly define the word order in noun phrases(left- or right-branching):


Chinese languages:  numeral-adjective-noun-postposition
Germanic languages: preposition-numeral-adjective-noun
Romance languages:  preposition-numeral-noun-adjective
Bantu languages:    preposition-noun-numeral-adjective

Tuki Nuwa is shaping up so far to be entirely right-branching,
but it'd be worth explicitly defining the canonical order;
or at least explicitly leaving it undefined.

Topic-Prominent Sentences
=========================

Need to write a proper lesson on how to use `wa` as a topic-marker,
and how to form topic-comment sentences.

Could also do with making sure I understand these myself

Embedded clauses
================

AKA Subordination in The Unfolding of Language, and probably elsewhere.

The argument can be made that embeddability only makes the grammar harder to learn,
and that a tool which is for basic communication needs to not make itself overly complex.

Perhaps the meaning of more complex constuctions in English can even be expressed,
in more roundabout ways in Tuki Nuwa.

Let's try translating these:

I wish I'd known you wanted to come with us  
*mi wilu i ni: mi jatun sawa i ni: si wilu mupa*

The list of reasons I want to do that is very small
The coat that I got from last year's fair is looking shabby now
[The fact] that you got her to do it for you is appalling
*ki si jatun namaku i lu...? *
*Si jatun namaku i lu li...?*

If I'd known you'd wanted to come with us, [then] I would have packed more food
*mi jatun sawa ki si jatun wilu li kama puki i mi muta wa, mi jatun awin i nami mulu*

After examining these, my current belief is that we need *some* form of embedding construction --
even if we only resort to contracting the Toki Pona solution into a single sentence
(a simple device which many natlangs have done historically):-

\*?`mi wilu i ni mi jatun sawa i ni si wilu mupa lon puki i mi muta`


The '__Cooked__ Fish' Problem
-----------------------------

Or, how to make adjectives out of completed verbs without being too verbose


If-Then Constructions
=====================

To do!

Auxiliary Verbs
===============

English has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, which Pinker says are used as 'function words', different than verbs etc.
They "assert something about the rest of the sentence as a whole".
Wikipedia says they "add functional or grammatical meaning to the clause in which it appears,
such as to express tense, aspect, modality, voice, emphasis etc"

Though a large group, it is a 'closed class' in natural languages; 
eg, one that is added to infrequently.

Right now, Tuki Nuwa just throws them in front of the rest of the sentence, as in English.
But should this be so?

* Should we use this system as in English?
* if so, how?
* if not, what other system can we use to encode meaning?
* (I am rather anglocentric here, can't think of another way to express this other than inflection)

how about a new grammar particle which comes between the auxiliary verb(s) and the actual verb phrase?

Examples/List
-----------------

these are actually more like modal verbs, but this document is under heavy WIP anyway.

```
start to
stop, finish xing
try to
fail to
<ability>could, able to
<obligation/expectation>should, ought (/must, have to)
want to
would
cause to
<certainty>:definitely
<probability>
allow

make sb do sth; force sb to do sth
allow

repeat
to be in the process of Xing
```

You know, all that auxiliary verbs do is modify the meaning of the verb they attach to,
like adverbs.

If there was an adverb in English meaning 'beginningly',
we could say "He is beginningly doing it," meaning "he's beginning to do it".

Nice idea?


Regularising Verb Valency Intuitively
=======================================

Or, How to Keep Verb Valency From Becoming an 
Idiosyncratic/Irregular Nightmare That's Unknowingly A Copy Of English

There-Are Constructions
=================

consider referring to the environment:

`lun ni li jaki huta`

this place is too dirty
(there's too much dirt)

`munisi Pi Sin li hapa tulu mupa pi milijun nuna`

city Beijing has       move-tool  9 million
"There are nine million bicycles in Beijing"

basically, my suggested strategy (until I find a breaking example)
is to make the location HAVE what there is, as the subject.

If there's no clear candidate for the subject, use `lun ni` or similar.

---------

All nouns only *have* an adjectival property:

*wata li hapa wata liki nisa* water **has** wet(ness)
\* *wata li wata liki* water **is** wet

Unnamed Candidate Words
=======================

The strategy here is to freely add potential words for concepts I know Tuki Nuwa doesn't have a word for,
then later delete the word if I can create a decent equivalent phrase which means the same thing.

The hardest part of creating a new word is finding a lexeme for it,
so that can be deferred until I know the word is definitely being added.

In the meantime, words without a lexeme will be referred to by a short version of their definition, in <angle brackets>.

### Key

symbol | meaning
-------|--------
++     | will definitely be included once I've decided on a lexeme.
+      | will probably be included, barring any new evidence or change of mind
?      | might be included; I'm on the fence/ not sure; undecided (possibly yet)
-      | might not be included; I've probably found a way to express the meaning of this word with a verbose phrase
--     | REALLY probably not going to add this.
adj    | adjective: describing word
sth    | something
sb     | someone/somebody

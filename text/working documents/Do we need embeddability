Sentences with embedded clauses in Tuki Nuwa
============================================

The argument can be made that embeddability only makes the grammar harder to learn,
and that a tool which is for basic communication needs to not make itself overly complex.

Perhaps the meaning of more complex constuctions in English can even be expressed,
in more roundabout ways in Tuki Nuwa.

Let's try translating these:

I wish I'd known you wanted to come with us
mi wilu i ni: mi jatun sawa i ni: si wilu mupa 
The list of reasons I want to do that is very small
The coat that I got from last year's fair is looking shabby now
[The fact] that you got her to do it for you is appalling
*ki si jatun namaku i lu...? *
*Si jatun namaku i lu li...?*

If I'd known you'd wanted to come with us, [then] I would have packed more food
*mi jatun sawa ki si jatun wilu li kama puki i mi muta wa, mi jatun awin i nami mulu*

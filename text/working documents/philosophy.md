This document describes changes having to do with my own variant of toki pona's philosophy
of simplicity and 'good'.

Toki Pona's goal of creating a Language of Good may not necessarily align with the goal of
creating an ideal auxiliary language.

For that, the language should be easy to learn, and be as easy to understand as possible.
AKA easy to learn, easy to use.

Complexity is not inherently bad; complexity is a tool. 
And like any tool, it can be used for good or bad -- in a good or bad way.
People who do bad don't always mean to.

------

Opinion on Toki Pona's Connotations
------------

Toki Pona conflates ideas of size with importance, and altitude with status.
These are classic 'metaphors' in many human languages, but ones which I think damage objectivity.
Are submarine crews of low status? are astronauts more important than kings? Their altitude shouldn't matter!

It's hard to find examples that don't reinforce this trope, it turns out.
People pay much more money for the top floor of a tall building.

This isn't just Toki Pona's problem; it may be a problem with human thought,
probably caused by evolutionary psychological biases: 
in pre-history, those at the highest point had the best chance of spotting predators, avoiding floods.

This probably gave those with a genetically-ordained preference for being higher up
a better chance of surviving long enough to mate.

-----

All words will use three or fewer syllables, but preferably two or fewer.

status:still OK!

-----

No words should be formed as a portmanteau from two (or more) existing words --
there is already a phrase for that, and if every concept received this treatment,
the language's number of words would grow exponentially.

------

Phrases should not be fossilised into static usages: new words in all but name.
The appropriate phrase to describe something is made from the thing's features
that are relevant to the current context.

The same phrases may pop up again and again, but that does not make them words.
That just increases the number of words to learn, 
some of which may not even be properly documented, 
and instead must be picked up from those 'in the know'.
It also means that `~`120 words is a lie.

Baaad toki pona. 

Instead, commonly used phrases for things should be intuitive enough to occur naturally to new speakers.
(That is, speakers who have just finished learning the language, and are using it for the first time,
construct the phrase from scratch in the same way as others.)

If they don't, they are just arbitrary symbols for things (AKA words) which learners would have to memorise.
They must be replaced by better phrases.

------

Use a 'medieval' numbering system -- similar to the french vigisemal ('four twenties and ten').
This might involve one or two new words to keep the number-parts straight,
properly separated from each other.

Toki Nawa should still have a version of Toki Pona's aversion to 'big' numbers -- 
you won't be able to describe numbers with more than 2 or 3 significant figures.

People prefer not to read out a lot of significant digits anyway (at least in English)

I still need to figure out how to make that limitation an inherent property.

un tu pi luka = one two of five = (1 + 2) * 5 = 15

-------

word order must be followed more strictly than in canonical toki pona -- 
see [Reading Toki Pona is Hard](http://www.suburbandestiny.com/?p=845)

-----

There's a loose 3-tiered system for the number of syllables a word has:

Single-syllable words are generally grammar-glue words, or very common words.

Double-syllable lexemes are used for common function words (be, do, go, food/feed etc).

Triple-syllable words are for the more obscure or esoteric words, and everything else.

-----

no separate words for artifical/natural versions of things; eg room = cave

don't have two words which only differ in meaning between

```
male/female,
human/animal/plant/machine,
artifical/natural,
animate/inanimate -- where possible.
actual, real/figurative, metaphorical
good/bad
```

where good means 'useful, helpful, altruistic, safe, seen favourably'
and bad means 'useless, unhelpful, harmful, evil, dangerous, seen unfavourably'

eg, room === cave; hand === paw; injured === damaged, page === leaf (which we already do sometimes in english)

might need to include words to specify which category when necessary

---------

(maybe) adopt do as a default auxiliary in any sentence that doesn't have some other modal/auxiliary verb (such as is, have, or con),
which means that ordinary verbs like 'go' no longer have past tense forms of their own: it's just 'i do go/i did go'

----

Policy for filling the dictionary (done once while building the vocab, not adding new words generally):
find a word from a language which is either widely spoken or has a lot of speakers, 
which can be simplified to fit tuki nuwa's phonotactics, and still be recognisable.

If that fails, make up a new sound which is sufficiently distinguished from existing words.

Where a lexeme for a word came from is irrelevant to learning or using the language, and has not been recorded.

------

Learning materials for the language should be worded as simply as possible. 
Getting bogged down in precise linguistic terminology is unnecessary for learning the language itself,
and alienates learners who aren't linguists, 
and forces linguistically-aware readers to scan over needless exposition.

Examples of words to avoid in general learning materials:

Diphthong
abjad, syllabary, logography etc
aspiration

-----

This language could be designed to work alongside any shared vocabulary two speakers may have;
eg if both speakers know the words, 'taxi',
(which can be checked by asking `ki si sawa i nimi "taxi"?`)

that word can be used instead of a roundabout phrase

-------

Chinese has not been used as a source of words, simply because it is beyond the capabilities of the author to read chinese,
or any of the romanisation systems.

Also, Chinese words distinguish by tone, meaning our toneless language would likely lose too much information
for chinese loanwords to be recognisable anyway.

------

every verb is present-tense active by default.

-----

provide a facility for defining new words for the duration of a conversation (or article, chapter, book etc).
These loanwords can come from shared knowledge the speakers have (words common to their language),
and don't have to strictly follow Tuki Nuwa's phonology rules.

It's helpful to define these loanwords at the beginning of the discourse.
These loanwords are expected to mostly consist of nouns specific to the topic,
serving as ad-hoc vocabulary which make conversations shorter.

----


Pursuant to this [linguistics answer](linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/1606/21863), I think my motivation for adding so many grammar-marker words is that  **I want to reduce ambiguity in embedded phrases**.

the example in [o kama sona lesson 6](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/okamasona6.php) of tawa being ambiguous because it is both a verb and a preposition.


----

look to [tok pisin](tok-pisin.com) for inspiration as to how pidgins solve problems of complexity, grammar,
and make meaning from relatively few words.

-----

After months of wondering why the syllable /ti/ is banned, 
I've come to decide that it's because it is wholly reserved
for the life-drink, the earth nectar, humanity's greatest invention:
Tea.

Obviously, no other word is allowed to despoil the beauty of the syllable for
The Best Drink.

Ti.

kiwu si wilu i Ti?

----------

maybe the meaning of a word as an adjective should be required to mean exactly the same thing as the word used as a noun.
eg, [todo: example] 
this would remove the problem that some 'words' (lexemes) are really a collection of closely-related (or sometimes not-so-closely-related) words which differ by part of speech -- meaning learning one word really means learning two or three words -- a noun, a verb, an adjective, and maybe something else.

(in my opinion, rolling several words into one lexeme like this is a bit of a 'cheat' to keep the word count down...)

-----

for a word that (in other languages) is a group of words with varying intensity,
maybe have those variable-intensity words all default to the same low/small intensity:
eg should/must/obligation starts as should without any modifiers

-------

Have a collection of third-person pronouns which are used for different entites in the context;
referents for the first, second and third things introduced in a discourse

have a small set of words whose meaning can be assigned in a sentence;
essentially pronouns, but which can stand in for any noun-phrase.

Each one can refer to something whose full description/name is too long.

These are called the proximate and obviative referents.

-----

consider making all verbs in the language have the same inherent stativity. That makes it so there's less to learn.

so all verbs could be stative, eg *mi lapi* = 'I am sleeping', not 'i go to sleep'.

Could use go to express the dynamic form, eg *mi mupa li lapi* = 'I go sleep'.

*lu li muhali* = he/she/it is dead

*lu li mupa li muhali* = he/she/it dies

*mi pali li muhali i lu* = I kill him/her/it


----

Successive *li*s in a sentence shouldn't connect the verbs with implied 'and's, as in Toki Pona.

Instead, the verbs should act as auxiliaries:

*li kama li kanu li mupa* - 'come to be able to move'

--------

consider this idea from 2 angles:

1. most words can't be verbs on their own -- they need a particle word from a small closed class, 
defining what kind of verb it is:

as a holdable object

become dead (die -- receive, gain death)
----

make sth dead (kill -- give death)
-----

be dead (without a time component)
-----

lose death (stop being dead)
----
let go of/abandon/lose/drop
un-become dead

scary vs scared -- habitually give fear vs has received fear
in the process of
take?
has verbed/has been verbed


as a quantity
------
* keep/hold/retain heat
* increase heat
    - make sth more hot
* decrease heat
    - make sth less hot


2. most words aren't verbs -- they need to be used with one of the few verbs in the language, 
to express the relevant process.
This avoids each word having its own stativity/passivity when used as a verb.



|
V
a --> b

a Xs (optional b, with c, at d, during e etc)



      |
      V
a --> b

b is Xed (by optional a)


 |
 V
 a ---+
/\    |
 |    |
  ----+

a Xs itself

------

Instead of using various prepositions & quantifiers for adding spatial, time, quantity modifiers to verbs ("move a little bit"),
just use adverbs:

move space-wise small
move speed-wise small
move quantity-wise small

------

maybe instead of having a word mean very similar things when used differently (eg suno = bright, light up, Light),

have the different POS uses have completely different meanings. This might lead to less ambiguity overall

----

Past 150, other good (memorable) numbers of words to have in the language:

250
300
360
365

-----

For the sake of recognisability, it may be worth including the vowels e and o again.
Recognisability of both spelling and pronunciation:
many romance words would become recognisable again with these.
`>=`5-vowel systems are very common cross-linguistically;

The only language which doesn't support this is Arabic; but
1. This is only Modern Standard Arabic, and
2. Arabic does have short and long vowels, so there may be some overlap with these.

-----

Our new word registry seems to be exploding with terms for different domains,
eg quality, moral goodness;
the idea we had earlier, that these are not just different senses of 'good',
is increasingly seeming like my own philosphical-language style bias,
and is becoming increasingly at odds with keeping the word count down 
(and by extension the language complexity as a whole)

Maybe it's ok just to use the word 'good' for a variety of meanings?!
I mean, English does it

-------------------

english is such a flexible, expressive language,
with a thousand ways to say anything.

Tuki Nuwa doesn't have to be as flexible as English, to be useful.

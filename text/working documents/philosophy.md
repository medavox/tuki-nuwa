This document describes changes having to do with my own variant of toki pona's philosophy
of simplicity and 'good'.

Toki Pona's goal of creating a Language of Good may not necessarily align with the goal of
creating an ideal auxiliary language.

For that, the language should be easy to learn, and be as easy to understand as possible.
AKA easy to learn, easy to use.

Complexity is not inherently bad.

Complexity is a tool; and like any tool, it can be used for good or bad; or in a good or bad way.
People who do bad don't always mean to.

Opinion on Toki Pona's Connotations
------------

Toki Pona conflates ideas of size with importance, and altitude with status.
These are classic 'metaphors' in many human languages, but ones which I think damage objectivity.
Are submarine crews of low status? are astronauts more important than kings? Their altitude shouldn't matter!

It's hard to find examples that don't reinforce this trope, it turns out.
People pay much more money for the top floor of a tall building.

This isn't just Toki Pona's problem; it may be a problem with human thought,
probably caused by evolutionary psychological biases: 
in pre-history, those at the highest point had the best chance of spotting predators, avoiding floods.

This probably gave those with a genetically-ordained preference for being higher up
a higher chance of surviving long enough to mate.

--------

the word *`pona`*'s conflations of several distinct concepts pushes toki pona towards a kind of lazy know-it-all:

the moral good != correct != easy

* the correct course of action isn't always whatever's easiest.
	- like doing the household chores.
* doing the right thing -- what it is morally right to do -- isn't always easy. 
	- Like admitting you did something bad.
* being right doesn't make you a good person; you can be an asshole with the truth. eg:-
	- "it's your own fault you're in this mess anyway; I don't have to help you".
	- "you're just upset because your family is dead",
	- "there's no point trying to save you -- you're probably going to die anyway"

status:implemented -- we now have the words puna, pasilu and tatu.

---------

The base list of words should use the research on 
[Semantic Primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_primes) and a 
[Natural Semantic Metalanguage](https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/schools-departments/natural-semantic-metalanguage). 
Multiple primes can still be rolled into one lexeme,
but I think all `~`64 semantic primes should be expressible in toki nawa.

this language will still lean heavily on phrases as compound words.

status:implemented

-----

All words will use three or fewer syllables, but preferably two or fewer.

status:still OK!

-----

* make the sounds for words align with the research on human-universal sound choices for primitive meanings

-----

No words should be formed as a portmanteau from two (or more) existing words --
there is already a phrase for that, and if every concept received this treatment,
the language's number of words would grow exponentially.

------

Phrases should not be fossilised into static usages: new words in all but name.
The appropriate phrase to describe something is made from the thing's features
that are relevant to the current context.

The same phrases may pop up again and again, but that does not make them words.
That just increases the number of words to learn, 
some of which may not even be properly documented, 
and instead must be picked up from those 'in the know'.
It also means that `~`120 words is a lie.

Baaad toki pona. 

Instead, commonly used phrases for things should be intuitive enough to occur naturally to new speakers.
(That is, speakers who have just finished learning the language, and are using for the first time,
construct the phrase from scratch in the same way as others.)

If they don't, they are just arbitrary symbols for things (AKA words) which learners would have to memorise.
They must be replaced by better phrases.

------

Use a 'medieval' numbering system -- similar to the french vigisemal ('four twenties and ten')
will be used. This might involve one or two new words to keep the number-parts straight,
properly separated from each other.

Toki Nawa should still have a version of Toki Pona's aversion to 'big' numbers -- 
you won't be able to describe numbers with more than 2 or 3 significant figures.

People prefer not to read out a lot of significant digits anyway (at least in English)

I still need to figure out how to make that limitation an inherent property.

un tu pi wuka = one two of five = (1 + 2) * 5 = 15

-------

word order must be followed more strictly than in canonical toki pona -- 
see [Reading Toki Pona is Hard](http://www.suburbandestiny.com/?p=845)

------

consider modifying or removing words for 'male' and 'female' to reflect non-binary reality. After all: GENDER IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT. Why have two whole words for easily splitting people into two groups based on an unimportant property?


-----

There's a loose 3-tiered system for the number of syllables a word has:

Single-syllable words are generally grammar-glue words, or very common words.

Double-syllable lexemes are used for common function words (be, do, go, food/feed etc).

Triple-syllable words are for the more obscure or esoteric words, and everything else.

------

I'm not using normal English terms for grammar (eg perfect), because they are outdated,
and have no relation whatsoever to the grammatical feature they represent.

For instance, I think calling it the complete tense is much clearer than calling it the perfect tense.

-----

no separate words for artifical/natural versions of things; eg room = cave

don't have two words which only differ in meaning between

```
male/female,
human/animal/plant/machine,
artifical/natural,
animate/inanimate -- where possible.
actual, real/figurative, metaphorical
good/bad
```

where good means 'useful, helpful, altruistic, seen favourably'
and bad means 'useless, unhelpful, evil, seen unfavourably'

eg, room === cave; hand === paw; injured === damaged, page === leaf (which we already do sometimes in english)

might need to include words to specify which category when necessary

---------

(maybe) adopt do as a default auxiliary in any sentence that doesn't have some other modal/auxiliary verb (such as is, have, or con),
which means that ordinary verbs like 'go' no longer have past tense forms of their own: it's just 'i do go/i did go'

----

Policy for filling the dictionary (done once while building the vocab, not adding new words generally):
find a word from a language which is either widely spoken or has a lot of speakers, 
which can be simplified to fit tuki nuwa's phonotactics, and still be recognisable.

If that fails, make up a new sound which is suitably distinguished from existing words.

Where a lexeme for a word came from is irrelevant to learning or using the language, and has not been recorded.

------

Learning materials for the language should be worded as simply as possible. Getting bogged down in precise linguistic terminology is unnecessary for learning the language itself, and only alienates learners who aren't linguists, and forces linguistically-aware readers to scan over needless exposition.

Examples of words to avoid in general learning materials:

Diphthong
abjad, syllabary, logography etc
aspiration

-----

This language could be designed to work alongside any shared vocabulary two speakers may have;
eg if both speakers know the words, 'taxi',
(which can be checked by asking `ki si sawa i nimi "taxi"?`)

that word can be used instead of a roundabout phrase

-------

Chinese has not been used as a source of words, simply because it is beyond the capabilities of the author to read chinese,
or any of the romanisation systems.

Also, Chinese words distinguish by tone, meaning our toneless language would likely lose too much information
for chinese loanwords to be recognisable anyway.

------

every verb is present-tense active by default.

-----

even if using single-vowel word endings to denote parts of speech didn't work,
still try and find a way to create a regular system of how words sound given their meaning,
so learners can make a likely guess at a word's meaning based on how it sounds.

The words don't vary by this system; they just follow a predictable pattern,
which helps in guessing their meaning

-----

provide a facility for defining new words for the duration of a conversation (or article, chapter, book etc).
These loanwords can come from shared knowledge the speakers have (words common to their language),
and don't have to strictly follow Tuki Nuwa's phonology rules.

It's helpful to define these loanwords at the beginning of the discourse.
These loanwords are expected to mostly consist of nouns specific to the topic,
serving as ad-hoc vocabulary which make conversations shorter.


have a small set of words whose meaning can be assigned in a sentence;
essentially pronouns, but which can stand in for any noun-phrase.

Each one can be used to talk about something whose full description/name is too long. 

----


Pursuant to this [linguistics answer](linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/1606/21863), I think my motivation for adding so many grammar-marker words is that  **I want to reduce ambiguity in embedded phrases**.

the example in [o kama sona lesson 6](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/okamasona6.php) of tawa being ambiguous because it is both a verb and a preposition.


----

look to [tok pisin](tok-pisin.com) for inspiration as to how pidgins solve problems of complexity, grammar,
and make meaning from relatively few words.

-----

After months of wondering why the syllable /ti/ is banned, 
I've come to decide that it's because it is wholly reserved
for the life-drink, the earth nectar, humanity's greatest invention:
Tea.

Obviously, no other word is allowed to despoil the beauty of the syllable for
The Best Drink.

Ti.

ki si wilu i Ti?

------


Answering yes-no questions without words for yes or no
------

This is less difficult than you might think:

*Ki si wilu nami?* 'Are you hungry'/'Do you want to eat?'

*tatu!* "correct!"
*mi wilu nami* "I want to eat"
*mi wilu nami ka!* "I do indeed want to eat!"

*mi wilu nami nata* "i don't want to eat"/"I'm not hungry"
or simply,
*nata*

----------

maybe the meaning of a word as an adjective should be required to mean exactly the same thing as the word used as a noun.
eg, [todo: example]
this would remove the problem that some 'words' (lexemes) are really a collection of closely-related (or sometimes not-so-closely-related) words which differ by part of speech -- meaning learning one word really means learning two or three words -- a noun, a verb, an adhective, and maybe something else.

(in my opinion, rolling several words into one lexeme like this is a 'trick' to keep the word count down...)

-----

for a word that (in other languages) is a group of words with varying intensity,
maybe have those variable-intensity words all default to the same low/small intensity:
eg should/must/obligation starts as should without any modifiers

-------

Have a collection of third-person pronouns which are used for different entites in the context;
referents for the first, second and third introduced things in a sentence

-----

nisa might be unnecessary, as the position of the phrase in the sentence indicates whether a word is a noun  
it's not unnecessary, because nouns may be used as part of a phrase, where their POS is ambiguous

-----

consider making all verbs in the language have the same inherent stativity. That makes it so there's less to learn.

so all verbs could be stative, eg *mi lapi* = 'I am sleeping', not 'i go to sleep'.

Could use go to express the dynamic form, eg *mi mupa li lapi* = 'I go sleep'.

*lu li muhali* = he/she/it is dead

*lu li mupa li muhali* = he/she/it dies

*mi pali li muhali i lu* = I kill him/her/it


----

Successuve *li*s in a sentence shouldn't connect the verbs with implied 'and's, as in Toki Pona.

Instead, the verbs should act as auxiliaries:

*li kama li kanu li mupa* - 'come to be able to move'

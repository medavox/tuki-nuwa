Prepositions
=======

these 3 are the 'main' prepositions:

* near, with, at
* towards, in order to, in the direction of
* away from, of

other meanings can be expressed with a preposition phrase,
in = 'at inside'
on 'at above'
under = 'at below'
through = 'towards at away'



into = 'towards inside'
onto = 'towards above'


some words we've already got, that are considered prepositions in English:
if we have words for those concepts, aren't they prepositions?

* before
* after
* of
* minus
* less
* like
* opposite
* sans/without

other words we might want, in some form (or some way of expressing):
* per
* since
* until
* via

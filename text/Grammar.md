Part-of-Speech Markers
=============

A word's role in a sentence is inferred from context, word-order, li and i markers etc.

But if a word's meaning couldn't be inferred from context,
or a more complex form is required,
explicit grammar words can be used to indicate part-of-speech, 
for instance in a complex noun phrase.

Forming Questions
==========

A statement can be turned into a question by preceding it with *ki*. 
This word can be roughly translated into English as *is it the case that...?*.

*Kuwi si wilu moku?* Do you want to eat?/Are you hungry?

*Kuwi mi muta li jan? ju kuwi mi muta li jan pi tawa musi?* Are we human? or are we dancers?

*miwi puna luku u, kuwi si wilu isun e win kapi?* do you want to buy a hat, pretty lady?

*kuwi jan nuwa li lapi?* (are the children/is the child) asleep?


Answering yes-no questions without words for yes or no
------

This is less difficult than you might think:

*Kuwi si wilu li nami?* 'Are you hungry'/'Do you want to eat?'

*tatu!* "correct!"
*mi wilu nami* "I want to eat"
*mi wilu nami ka!* "I do indeed want to eat!"

*mi wilu nami nata* "i don't want to eat"/"I'm not hungry"
or simply,
*nata*


Forming if-Then Constructions

Degrees of Intensity & Making Comparisons
========

Because Tuki Nuwa has so few words, 
there's often only one word to express a certain concept.

[todo: examples]

In order to express greater or lesser degrees of intensity,
or even the opposite end of the 'scale',
Tuki Nuwa has a rich set of intensity words:

Quantity, amount and intensity are all expressed with the same class of words:

Word     | Meaning in English
---------|--------------
huta     | too
pulan    | fully
makisu   | most
mulu     | MORE
muta     | VERY/MANY
satisu   | enough
sumin    | SOME, somewhat
sama     | same, equal
lili     | slightly, a little, a bit
nuni     | close, near
mina     | less
nata     | not
kika     | absence
anti     | opposite

`mi pulan huta. Mi manta i ni: mi hinsu pa!`

"I'm too full. I think I'm going to burst!"

Topic Marker
===========

*Wa* can be used in a number of ways. 

It can be used for describing __when__ something happened:

*Ipuki pini wa, mi jatun nami nata i kiwi suwi*

In the past, I didn't eat fruit (or I didn't eat the fruit)

It can also be used to separate a complex subject- or object-phrase from the rest of the sentence

Past, Present and Future
======

When a verb takes place in the present, we use li to seperate the noun doing the verb, from the verb itself.

If it happens in the future , we use `hinsu`:

If it happens in the past , we use `jatun`:



Reflexive Pronouns
======

If the subject of a sentence does something to itself, we use *sama* after the object:

*lu li nimi i lu sama na Alex*

she calls herself Alex


*mi sanita i mi sama*

I'm washing (cleaning) myself


--------

You can use the Part-Of-Speech-Marking words to precisely refer to a specific concept, if needs be.

Using *kala* "fish / fishy, fish-like / to swim" (noun, adjective or verb -- depending on use in sentence):

*liki kala* "fishy"  
*ula kala* "to swim"  
*nisa kala* "(a) fish"  

*nisa liki kala* "fishiness (the degree to which something is fishy, or the state of being fishy), fishness (the quality of being fish-like), fish-hood"  
*ula liki kala* "to make something fishy"
*nisa ula liki kala* "the act of making something fishy"

*nisa ula kala* "swimming"

*liki ula kala* "swimmy; of or related to swimming". eg tulu luku pi liki ula kala - eye tools for swimming = swimming goggles.
*nisa liki ula kala* "swimminess -- being related to swimming, or the degree to which something is swimmy"
*ula nisa kala* "doing something related to fish" you might think "fishing", but no -- that would be *awasa kala*.

6 rules emerge:

ula  *noun* - doing something related to *noun*
liki *noun* - *noun*y; *noun*-like

nisa *verb* - *verb*ing; the act of *verb*ing
liki *verb* - *verb*y; of or relating to *verb*

nisa *adj* - *adj*iness; the degree to which something is *adj*-like
ula  *adj* - *adj*ify; to make something *adj*-like

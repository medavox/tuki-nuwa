* To emphasise an adjective, repeat that adjective. Or use whatever passes for 'very' these days


Part-of-Speech Markers
=============

A word's role in a sentence is inferred from context, word-order, li and i markers etc.

But if a word's meaning can't be inferred, or a more complex form is required, explicit grammar words can be used to indicate part-of-speech, for instance in a complex noun phrase.

Forming Questions
==========

A statement can be turned into a question by preceding it with *ki*. This word roughly translates as *is it the case that*.

*Ki si wilu moku?* Do you want to eat?/Are you hungry?

*Ki mi muta li jan? ju ki mi muta li jan pi tawa musi?* Are we human? or are we dancers?

*jan miwi puna luku u, ki si wilu isun e win kapi?* do you want to buy a hat, pretty lady?

*ki jan nuwa li lapi?* (are the children/is the child) asleep?

Forming if-Then Constructions

Making Comparisons

Topic Marker
===========

*Wa* can be used in a number of ways. 

It can be used for describing __when__ something happened:

*Ipuki pini wa, mi jatun nami nata i kiwi suwi*

In the past, I didn't eat fruit (or I didn't eat the fruit)

It can also be used to separate a complex subject- or object-phrase from the rest of the sentence

Past, Present and Future
======

When a verb takes place in the present, we use li to seperate the noun doing the verb, from the verb itself.

If it happens in the future or the past, we use different words blah1 and blah2:



Reflexive Pronouns
======

If the subject of a sentence does something to itself, we use *sama* after the object:

*lu li nimi i lu sama na Alex*

she calls herself Alex

*mi kika jaki i mi sama*

I'm washing ("removing dirt" from) myself


--------

You can use the Part-Of-Speech-Marking words to precisely refer to a specific concept, if needs be.

Using *kala* "fish / fishy, fish-like / to swim" (noun, adjective or verb -- depending on use in sentence):

*liki kala* "fishy"  
*ula kala* "to swim"  
*nisa kala* "(a) fish"  

*nisa liki kala* "fishiness (the degree to which something is fishy, or the state of being fishy), fishness (the quality of being fish-like), fish-hood"  
*ula liki kala* "to make something fishy"
*nisa ula liki kala* "the act of making something fishy"

*nisa ula kala* "swimming"

*liki ula kala* "swimmy; of or related to swimming". eg tulu luku pi liki ula kala - eye tools for swimming = swimming goggles.
*nisa liki ula kala* "swimminess -- being related to swimming, or the degree to which something is swimmy"
*ula nisa kala* "doing something related to fish" you might think "fishing", but no -- that would be *awasa kala*.

6 rules emerge:

ula  *noun* - doing something related to *noun*
liki *noun* - *noun*y; *noun*-like

nisa *verb* - *verb*ing; the act of *verb*ing
liki *verb* - *verb*y; of or relating to *verb*

nisa *adj* - *adj*iness; the degree to which something is *adj*-like
ula  *adj* - *adj*ify; to make something *adj*-like

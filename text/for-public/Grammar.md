* To emphasise an adjective, repeat that adjective. Or use whatever passes for 'very' these days


Part-of-Speech Markers
=============

A word's role in a sentence is inferred from context, word-order, li and i markers etc.

But if a word's meaning can't be inferred, or a more complex form is required, explicit grammar words can be used to indicate part-of-speech, for instance in a complex noun phrase.



Forming Questions
==========

A statement can be turned into a question by preceding it with *ki*. This word roughly translates as *is it the case that*.

*Ki si wilu moku?* Do you want to eat?/Are you hungry?

*Ki mi muta li jan? ju ki mi muta li jan pi tawa musi?* Are we human? or are we dancers?

*jan miwi puna luku u, ki si wilu isun e win kapi?* do you want to buy a hat, pretty lady?

*ki jan nuwa li lapi?* (are the children/is the child) asleep?

Topic Marker
===========

*Wa* can be used in a number of ways. 

It can be used for describing __when__ something happened:

*Ipuki pini wa, mi nami nata e kiwi suwi*

In the past, I didn't eat fruit (or I didn't eat the fruit)

It can also be used to separate a complex subject- or object-phrase from the rest of the sentence

Past, Present and Future
======

When a verb takes place in the present, we use li to seperate the noun doing the verb, from the verb itself.

If it happens in the future or the past, we use different words blah1 and blah2:



Reflexive Pronouns
======

If someone does something to oneself, we use *sama*:

*lu li nimi lu sama na Alex*

she calls herself Alex


Some General Grammar
=========

Tenses
----

present/past/future -- whether the verb took place in the present, past or future. default: present

In Tuki Nuwa, these are expressed with either *li* (present),
 *jatun* (past) or *hinsu* (future) between the subject and the verb.

eg:

*lu li nami* = 'he's eating'
*lu jatun nami* = 'he ate'
*lu hinsu nami* = 'he'll eat

In the classical interpretations of the grammar of some languages, 
all sorts of concepts are sometimes lumped in under tense.

But these interpretations are wrong, at least in this theory of grammar.
They're only kept around because of literary/academic tradition.

However, some other interesting distinctions to actually make would be:
distant past vs recent past,
near future vs distant future

Voices (Passivity)
------

whether they happen *to* the subject, or the subject does them to an object

default: active

active -- the subject is the one doing the verb 
passive -- the verb is being done to the subject.

Aspects
-----

how the verb extends over time. default: simple


English also inflects verbs for whether their action is complete, ongoing, 
or some hypothetical action that frequently/habitually takes place

habitual: *john dances*; *john likes to dance*

name       | Old Name  | Description                              | Example
-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------|-----------
complete   | perfect   | a completed action                       | 'john has danced'
simple     | perfective| single unit of time                      | 'john dances'
continuous |progressive| an ongoing state or action               | 'john is dancing'
habitual   |           | this verb occurs multiple discrete times | 'john dances'
starting   | inchoative| the action or state is starting
prospective|           | going to start


static(stative)/dynamic
------


whether the verb contains change over time (stand up, go to sleep, combust),
 or a state the subject is in (sleeping, standing, burning). 

default: inherent to the verb. stative verbs cannot use continuous aspect, eg \*'i am knowing the answer'

whether they represent something which changes over time,
or are just something the subject generally does,
the verb is an action which can take place at a defined point in time

we probably don't need gramatical markers for this category: 
words don't usually differ in meaning by whether they indicate a change over time.

transitivity
----

if the verb was a function, then how many arguments it would take: 1, 2 or 3?

intransitive (1 argument): just the subject doing the thing

*john is dancing*

`dance(john)`

or

`john.dance()`

transitive (2 arguments): the subject does something to another thing, the object

*john kicks the ball*

`kick(john, ball)`

or

`john.kick(ball)`

ditransitive (3 arguments): the does something to/at the object, which involves an indirect object
 
*john gives the ball to Mary*

`give(john, ball, mary)`

or 

`john.give(ball, mary)`

transitivity is more up for debate: it may not be a sophisticated enough system for desrcibing
what is actually going on with language. 

Pinker suggests in thr language instinct that each verb is listed in the mental dictionary
as needing a specific set of arguments, each with a type (such as noun phrase, preposition-phrase).

Moods
----

More like the class of communication structure a sentence falls into.


Moods generally are either epistemic or deontic, and realis or irrealis

### Realis vs Irrealis

realis moods describe something in the real world, factual.

Irrealis moods are all about potentials, possibilities, hypotheticals.

### Deontic vs Epistemic

deontic -- could, should, must, desire

epistemic -- likelihood or possibility, inferentiality

Can be any one of these (or other more obscure ones; the mood category is pretty open-ended).

imperative - *u <verb>!*
interrogative - *ki si wilu nami?* 'do you want to eat?', *si wilu i simi* 'what do you want?'
indicative -- statement of fact -- *suwilu li nami i kiwi* 'animal eat(s) fruit'
conditional, subjunctive, optative -- if I were a rich man...



SO every verb has inherent stativity, picks a tense, aspect, voice; and is used in a particular mood.

--------

We need to explicitly define the word order in noun phrases(left- or right-branching):

Chinese languages:  numeral-adjective-noun-postposition
Germanic languages: preposition-numeral-adjective-noun
Romance languages:  preposition-numeral-noun-adjective
Bantu languages:    preposition-noun-numeral-adjective

---------

All nouns only *have* an adjectival property:

*wata li hapa wata liki nisa* water **has** wet(ness)
\* *wata li wata liki* water **is** wet

-----

You can use the Part-Of-Speech-Marking words to precisely refer to a specific concept, if needs be.

Using *kala* "fish / fishy, fish-like / to swim" (noun, adjective or verb -- depending on use in sentence):

*liki kala* "fishy"  
*ula kala* "to swim"  
*nisa kala* "(a) fish"  

*nisa liki kala* "fishiness (the degree to which something is fishy, or the state of being fishy), fishness (the quality of being fish-like), fish-hood"  
*ula liki kala* "to make something fishy"
*nisa ula liki kala* "the act of making something fishy"

*nisa ula kala* "swimming"

*liki ula kala* "swimmy; of or related to swimming". eg tulu luku pi liki ula kala - eye tools for swimming = swimming goggles.
*nisa liki ula kala* "swimminess -- being related to swimming, or the degree to which something is swimmy"
*ula nisa kala* "doing something related to fish" you might think "fishing", but no -- that would be *awasa kala*.

6 rules emerge:

ula  *noun* - doing something related to *noun*
liki *noun* - *noun*y; *noun*-like

nisa *verb* - *verb*ing; the act of *verb*ing
liki *verb* - *verb*y; of or relating to *verb*

nisa *adj* - *adj*iness; the degree to which something is *adj*-like
ula  *adj* - *adj*ify; to make something *adj*-like

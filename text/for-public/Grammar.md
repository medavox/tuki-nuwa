* To emphasise an adjective, repeat that adjective. Or use whatever passes for 'very' these days


Part-of-Speech Markers
=============

Words have an inherent or default part-of-speech role, indicated by their vowel ending (or no inherent role if they end in n).

A word's role in a sentence can often be inferred from context, word-order, li and i markers etc.

But explicit grammar words can be used to indicate part-of-speech when deemed necessary, for instance in a complex noun phrase.



Forming Questions
==========

A statement can be turned into a question by preceding it with *ki*. This word roughly translates as *is it the case that*.

*Ki si wilu moku?* Do you want to eat?/Are you hungry?

*Ki mi muta jan? ju ki mi muta jan pi tawa musi?* Are we human? or are we dancers?

*jan miwi puna luku u, ki si wilu isun e win kapi?* do you want to buy a hat, pretty lady?

*ki jan nuwa li lapi?* (are the children/is the child) asleep?

Topic Marker
===========

*Wa* can be used in a number of ways. 

It can be used for describing __when__ something happened:

*Ipuki pini wa, mi nami nata e kiwi suwi*

In the past, I didn't eat fruit (or I didn't eat the fruit)

It can also be used to separate a complex subject- or object-phrase from the rest of the sentence

Past, Present and Future
======

When a verb takes place in the present, we use li to seperate the noun doing the verb, from the verb itself.

If it happens in the future or the past, we use different words blah1 and blah2:



Reflexive Pronouns
======

If someone does something to oneself, we use *sama*:

*lu li nimi lu sama na Alex*

she calls herself Alex


Some General Grammar
=========

Tenses
----

present/past/future -- whether the verb took place in the present, past or future. default: present

In the classical interpretations of the grammar of some languages, 
all sorts of other things are sometimes lumped in under tense.

But these interpretations are wrong, at least in this theory of grammar.
They're only still kept around because of academic tradition.

However, some interesting distinctions to make would be:
distant past vs recent past,
near future vs distant future

Voices
------

default: active

active -- the subject is the one doing the verb 
passive -- the verb is being done to the subject.

Aspects
-----

how the verb extends over time. default: simple

* complete(perfect) -- a completed action
* simple(perfective) -- single unit of time
* continuous/progressive -- an ongoing state or action
* habitual -- this verb occurs multiple discrete times
* starting(inchoative) -- the action or state is starting
* prospective -- going to start

Inherent Verb Properties
----------
static(stative)/dynamic -- whether the verb contains change over time (an action), or a state the subject is in. default: inherent to the verb. stative verbs cannot use continuous aspect, eg \*'i am knowing the answer'
intransitive

Moods
----

More like the class of communication structure a sentence falls into.


Moods generally are either epistemic or deontic, and realis or irrealis

### Realis vs Irrealis

realis moods describe something in the real world, factual.

Irrealis moods are all about potentials, possibilities, hypotheticals.

### Deontic vs Epistemic

deontic -- could, should, must, desire

epistemic -- likelihood or possibility, inferentiality

Can be any one of these (or other more obscure ones; the mood category is pretty open-ended).

imperative - *u <verb>!*
interrogative - *ki si wilu nami?* 'do you want to eat?', *si wilu i simi* 'what do you want?'
indicative -- statement of fact -- *suwilu li nami i kiwi* 'animal eat(s) fruit'
conditional, subjunctive, optative -- 



SO every verb has inherent stativity, picks a tense, aspect, voice; and is used in a particular mood.

Syntactic Bestiary
=================

from the Syntax Construction Kit by Mark Rosenfelder
I'm not listing concepts I know I don't want.

* Negative

Passive
------

Passive can be seen in several ways:

* It promotes the direct object (and sometimes other objects) to subject position
* It turns an accusative (or oblique) into a nominative
* It reduces the valence of the verb by one

English really has two passives: *Martha was robbed*; *Marth got robbed*.
The *got* passive sounds strange with inanimates


Causative
---------

Judith caused [her students love syntactic trees]
-> Judith caused her students to love syntactic trees

Increases the valence of a verb by one. Many languages have causatives as an inflection that
applies to any verb.

Conjunction
----------

Where one constituent can go, you canalso put two, conjoined with *and*, *or*, *but*.

Replacement
===========

Pronominalisation
----------------

a constituent can be replaced with an anaphor.
In English, these vary by type of constituent.

See the book, I'm not typing that all out.

Reflexivisation
---------


Echo Questions
------------

You gave the laser to John -> You gave the laser to **who**?

Movement
========

Neg-Hopping
---------

The rites may have been **not** observed.

-> The rites may have **not** been observed.

-> The rites may **not** have  been observed.

In Mandarin [adam: and I believe German], you can't move your negator;
or to put it another way, you negate only the specific word that's being denied.

These are different:

Tamen dou bu  qu
they  all not go
None of them are going

Tamen bu dou qu
they  not all go
Not all of them are going


Preposition-Phrase Scrambling
----------------------------

In English, sentence-level PPs can be fairly freely re-ordered.

We talked (in the basement) (about our problems) (for days) (until dawn) (without stopping)

Heavy-NounPhrase backing
-----------------------

A long or complex NP can be moved to the end of its clause, where a shorter NP must stay where it is.

*We consider them blameless* -> \* *We consider blameless them*

*We consider the linguistics faculty of the University of Verduria, as well as its most prominent alumni, blameless*

-> *We consider blameless the linguistics faculty of the University of Verduria, as well as its most prominent alumni*

As-Preposing
----------

As Noam is smart, Mensa is sure to accept him.

-> *Smart as Noam is, Mensa is sure to accept him.*

Also works with *though*.

*Wayward though Selina is, she still won't steal from the poor.*

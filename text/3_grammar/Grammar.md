* To emphasise an adjective, repeat that adjective. Or use whatever passes for 'very' these days


Topic Marker
===========

*Wa* can be used in a number of ways. 

It can be used for describing __when__ something happened:

*Ipuki pini wa, mi jatun nami nata i kiwi suwi*

In the past, I didn't eat fruit (or I didn't eat the fruit)

It can also be used to separate a complex subject- or object-phrase from the rest of the sentence

Part-of-Speech Markers
=============

A word's role in a sentence is inferred from li and i markers, word-order, context etc.

But if a word's meaning wouldn't be inferred from context,
or a more complex form is required,
explicit grammar words can be used to indicate part-of-speech, 
for instance in a complex noun phrase.

You can use the Part-Of-Speech-Marking words to precisely refer to a specific concept, if needs be.

Using *kala* "fish / fishy, fish-like / to swim" (noun, adjective or verb -- depending on use in sentence):

*liki kala* "fishy"  
*ula kala* "to swim"  
*nisa kala* "(a) fish"  

*nisa liki kala* "fishiness (the degree to which something is fishy, or the state of being fishy), fishness (the quality of being fish-like), fish-hood"  
*ula liki kala* "to make something fishy"
*nisa ula liki kala* "the act of making something fishy"

*nisa ula kala* "swimming"

*liki ula kala* "swimmy; of or related to swimming". eg tulu luku pi liki ula kala - eye tools for swimming = swimming goggles.
*nisa liki ula kala* "swimminess -- being related to swimming, or the degree to which something is swimmy"
*ula nisa kala* "doing something related to fish" you might think "fishing", but no -- that would be *awasa kala*.

6 rules emerge:

ula  *noun* - doing something related to *noun*
liki *noun* - *noun*y; *noun*-like

nisa *verb* - *verb*ing; the act of *verb*ing
liki *verb* - *verb*y; of or relating to *verb*

nisa *adj* - *adj*iness; the degree to which something is *adj*-like
ula  *adj* - *adj*ify; to make something *adj*-like

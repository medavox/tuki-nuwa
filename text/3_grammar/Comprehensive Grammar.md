Subject/Verb/Object Order
========================

Prepositions
===========

Branching
=========

We need to explicitly define the word order in noun phrases
(left- or right-branching):


Chinese languages:  numeral-adjective-noun-postposition
Germanic languages: preposition-numeral-adjective-noun
Romance languages:  preposition-numeral-noun-adjective
Bantu languages:    preposition-noun-numeral-adjective

Tuki Nuwa is shaping up so far to be entirely right-branching,
but it'd be worth explicitly defining the canonical order;
or at least explicitly leaving it undefined.

Whatever the decision, the language docs need to say something about it.


(noun adjective, or adjective noun?)
    and the rest (BAGS)

Tense -- Past, Present and Future
================================

When a verb takes place in the present, we use li to seperate the noun doing the verb, from the verb itself.

If it happens in the future , we use `hinsu`:

If it happens in the past , we use `jatun`:


Aspect
======

Modality/Mood
========

Voice (Passivity)
=====

Whether a verb happens *to* the subject, or the subject does the verb to the object

default: active

active -- the subject is the one doing the verb 
passive -- the verb is being done to the subject.

"Some languages have even more grammatical voices. For example, Classical Mongolian features five voices: active, passive, causative, reciprocal, and cooperative. Hebrew has active, passive, causative, intensive and reflexive voices.

The antipassive voice deletes or demotes the object of transitive verbs, and promotes the actor to an intransitive subject. This voice is very common among ergative–absolutive languages (which may feature passive voices as well), but also occurs among nominative–accusative languages. "

does that mean that reflexiveness is a voice?

Forming Questions
==========

A statement can be turned into a question by preceding it with *ki*. 
This word can be roughly translated into English as *is it the case that...?*.

*Kuwi si wilu moku?* Do you want to eat?/Are you hungry?

*Kuwi mi muta li jan? ju kuwi mi muta li jan pi tawa musi?* Are we human? or are we dancers?

*miwi puna luku u, kuwi si wilu isun e win kapi?* do you want to buy a hat, pretty lady?

*kuwi jan nuwa li lapi?* (are the children/is the child) asleep?

Answering yes-no questions without words for yes or no
------

Toki Kaja has no words for "yes" or "no". 
So how do you answer a yes-no question?

This is easier than you might think:

*Kuwi si wilu li nami?* 'Are you hungry'/'Do you want to eat?'

*tatu!* "correct!"
*mi wilu nami* "I want to eat"
*mi wilu nami ka!* "I do indeed want to eat!"

*mi wilu nami nata* "i don't want to eat"/"I'm not hungry"
or simply,
*nata*

Celtic languages have managed this way for millennia.

Conditional Sentences (If-Then)
==============================

There-Are
========

Subordinate/Dependent Clauses
============================

* [The rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_sentence)

3 types:

Content (noun) Clauses
-----

These function as nouns themselves. There are 2 types, 
Declarative and Interrogative:


Relative (adjectival) Clauses
----------------------------

These modify a noun phrase

Adverbial Clauses
-----------

Most complex of the 3 types.

Functions as an adverb; that is, modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb



Converting to/from other parts of speech
=======================================

Number-Pronouncing System
========================

Valency - Default, How to Increase, Decrease
========================================

Languages that mark arguments morphologically can have true "tritransitive" verbs, such as the causative of a ditransitive verb in Abaza (which incorporates all four arguments in the sentence "He couldn't make them give it back to her" as pronominal prefixes on the verb).[

Reflexive Pronouns
======

If the subject of a sentence does something to itself, we use *sama* after the object:

*lu li nimi i lu sama na Alex*

she calls herself Alex


*mi sanita i mi sama*

I'm washing (cleaning) myself


Possession
==========

For simple phrases, possession is indicated by word order:

*animu mi* 

my animal

For more complex constructions, 
the possessor and possessee can be optionally marked with *se*:

*jan juwa mewi se jan lekali putala*

(The) policeman's daughter

Imperatives
==========

Imperatives are formed by sticking the *u* particle in front of a verb phrase:

*u sanita i tomu si!*

Clean your room/house!

Intensifiers & Comparatives
========

Because Tuki Nuwa has so few words, 
there's often only one word to express a certain concept.

[todo: examples]

In order to express greater or lesser degrees of intensity,
or even the opposite end of the 'scale',
Tuki Nuwa has a rich set of intensity words:

Quantity, amount and intensity are all expressed with the same class of words:

Word     | Meaning in English
---------|--------------
huta     | too
pulan    | fully
makisu   | most
mulu     | MORE
muta     | VERY/MANY
satisu   | enough
sumin    | SOME, somewhat
sama     | same, equal
lili     | slightly, a little, a bit
nuni     | close, near
mina     | less
nata     | not
kika     | absence
anti     | opposite

`mi pulan huta. Mi menta i ni: mi hinsu pa!`

"I'm too full. I think I'm going to burst!"

Some General Grammar
=========

Tenses
----

present/past/future -- whether the verb took place in the present, past or future. default: present

In Tuki Nuwa, these are expressed with either *li* (present),
 *jatun* (past) or *hinsu* (future) between the subject and the verb.

eg:

*lu li nami* = 'he's eating'
*lu jatun nami* = 'he ate'
*lu hinsu nami* = 'he'll eat

In the classical interpretations of the grammar of some languages, 
all sorts of concepts are sometimes lumped in under tense.

But these interpretations are wrong, at least in this theory of grammar.
They're only kept around because of literary/academic tradition.

However, some other interesting distinctions to actually make would be:
distant past vs recent past,
near future vs distant future

Voices (Passivity)
------

whether they happen *to* the subject, or the subject does them to an object

default: active

active -- the subject is the one doing the verb 
passive -- the verb is being done to the subject.

Aspects
-----

how the verb extends over time. default: simple


English also inflects verbs for whether their action is complete, ongoing, 
or some hypothetical action that frequently/habitually takes place

habitual: *john dances*; *john likes to dance*

name       | Old Name  | Description                              | Example
-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------|-----------
complete   | perfect   | a completed action                       | 'john has danced'
simple     | perfective| single unit of time                      | 'john dances'
continuous |progressive| an ongoing state or action               | 'john is dancing'
habitual   |           | this verb occurs multiple discrete times | 'john dances'
starting   | inchoative| the action or state is starting
prospective|           | going to start


Stativity
--------

choices: static(stative) / dynamic


whether the verb contains change over time (stand up, go to sleep, combust),
 or a state the subject is in (sleeping, standing, burning). 

default: inherent to the verb. stative verbs cannot use continuous aspect, eg \*'i am knowing the answer'

whether they represent something which changes over time,
or are just something the subject generally does,
the verb is an action which can take place at a defined point in time

we probably don't need gramatical markers for this category: 
words don't usually differ in meaning by whether they indicate a change over time.

transitivity
----

if the verb was a function, then how many arguments it would take: 1, 2 or 3?

intransitive (1 argument): just the subject doing the thing

*john is dancing*

`dance(john)`

or

`john.dance()`

transitive (2 arguments): the subject does something to another thing, the object

*john kicks the ball*

`kick(john, ball)`

or

`john.kick(ball)`

ditransitive (3 arguments): the does something to/at the object, which involves an indirect object
 
*john gives the ball to Mary*

`give(john, mary, ball)`

or 

`john.give(mary, ball)`

transitivity is more up for debate: it may not be a sophisticated enough system for desrcibing
what is actually going on with language. 

In **The Language Instinct**, Pinker suggests that each verb is listed in the mental dictionary
as needing a specific set of arguments, each with a type (such as noun phrase, preposition-phrase).

valency
------

This more complex system is called valency, and we're going to start looking at it.

Along with the already-described transitivity options, there are extra types of valency:

Transitivity    | Valency     | verb arguments | example
----------------|-------------|----------------|------------
(not described) | Avalent     | 0 (only takes a dummy argument) | the *it* in "It's raining" refers to nothing
intransitive    | monovalent  | 1              | He slept
transitive      | bivalent    | 2              | They stabbed Jon
ditransitive    | trivalent?  | 3              | He gave Mary the ball

Some verbs only take a certain type of argument;
eg in English, the second argument of the verb *put* must be a locative clause (describing a location):

I put the cup *on the table*

\*I put the cup *table*

The concept of valency could even be extended to describe complex set phrases, such as if/then.

Moods
----

More like the class of communication structure a sentence falls into.


Moods generally are either epistemic or deontic, and realis or irrealis

### Realis vs Irrealis

realis moods describe something in the real world, factual.

Irrealis moods are all about potentials, possibilities, hypotheticals.

### Deontic vs Epistemic

deontic -- could, should, must, desire

epistemic -- likelihood or possibility, inferentiality

Can be any one of these (or other more obscure ones; the mood category seems pretty open-ended).

fancy mood name | description    | example
----------------|----------------|--------
indicative      | a statement    | *mi wilu nami* 'I want to eat'
interrogative   | a question     | *ki si wilu nami?* 'do you want to eat?'; *si wilu i simi* 'what do you want?'
imperative      | a command      | *u nami!* 'Eat!'
conditional, subjunctive, optative -- if I were a rich man...



SO every verb has inherent stativity, picks a tense, aspect, voice; and is used in a particular mood.

merge new grammar word 'liki' with 'sama'
    remove current meanings of sama:
    identical (use sama with fully for same effect)
    equivalent

partial overlap
----

kika and nata
merge/separate lula and kaja
merge/separate tapalu and pali?
kama and pasa both mean happen
expand/convert puki to more mean 'near'?; merge with nuni
tusa, pima, lawan all mean touch

---

difference between 'many times' and 'much of the time'?

solution: don't use the word time to mean 'occurrences'

So instead, say 'I do that frequently'

or even (the equivalents of) often and for a long time?

how to say 'show me sth'?
    you could say mi wilu luku i sth,
    but how to make it a command?
        u jupa luku puha i sth na mi?
        'make be-seen sth to me'
    how about *u nisunta li luku i mi na ni*
    'allow/let me to see that' (is it i mi na ni, or i ni na mi?)
    *u nisunta i ni: mi luku i ni*?

how to express the back or re- part of:
    give back
    take back
    come back
    return
all these words represent a return to a previous state; do we need to be able to express this?
why not instead just:
    give again
    take
    come again
    go again

difference between vt 'make someone laugh' and vt 'laugh at someone'?

replace *pasila* 'simple' with a word for 'complexity |  complicate | complex, complicated'

how to convey an adjective which is completed transforming verb? eg cooked fish

in fact, this points to a larger set of noun/verb relationships:

something which verbs
something which has been verbed

something which verbed?
something which will verb
something which is verbed (habitually),
something which is being verbed (currently)
normal/can

...

something which can verb
something which can be verbed

something which:

x                     | present              | past                  | future
----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------
normal (active)       | verbs                | verbed                | will verb
passive               | is verbed            | was verbed            | will be verbed
continuous            | is verbing           | was verbing           | will be verbing
complete              | has verbed           | was verbed            | 
passive complete      | has been verbed      | was verbed
passive continuous    | is being verbed      | was being verbed      | will be being verbed


this points to the larger issue of embeddability: being able to embed phrases with 'which' or 'that'.

-----

The Embeddability Problem
-----------

In sentences with single nouns as subject, single verbs as verb, and single nouns again as object, 
knowing which POS each word fulfills is easy: it's marked right there with *li* and *i*:

*suwilu li nami i kala* The animal eats the fish

But in sentences where one of these roles in the sentence is realised by a phrase
(eg noun-phrase verb-phrase)
it gets harder to tell what each word is doing:

*suwilu kala li nami pilusi i akisi* The (swimming animal? fish-animal?)

If a noun-phrased is composed of two or more nouns, where the first noun is qualified by the rest
(eg fish scarf. You know, a scarf for fish),
then in Tuki Nuwa, it can be hard to tell which POS the qualifying words are acting as.
And which POS they realise can change the meaning of the sentence:

*tumu kala* could be fish room or swimming room.

It gets even worse in longer phrases:

"the scarf I gave to your mother"

maybe that could also be 

"the giving scarf of your mother"

within a compound noun- or verb- phrase, tuki nuwa has no way to mark parts of speech.


Possible Solutions
------

### 1. Ignore it.

Hey, it works for Toki Pona! It's possibly even a deliberate 'feature',
restricting the complexity of sentence formations so you can only 'think simply'.

Bleh. I don't like it.

### 2. Introduce phrase-internal markers

these would function similarly to the sentence-level markers, but because they were different words,
you could keep track of which verb was actually the sentence-verb.

This is ok, but might just push the problem down a level 
(which might be ok for human languages -- how many level of recursion do we really need?).

Having further complexity 
(noun-phrases *made of other noun-phrases*, which might themselves be made of still deeper noun-phrases...) 
would probably require further levels of effectively duplicate words, for different levels of word.

This smacks of a case-inflection system, is highly duplicative, and a little bit latiny. Euch.

### 3. Use (optional) POS marker, let the reader figure the rest out

Here we have some words which just mark what kind of POS the word is.
Nothing too complex -- no separate words for which *kind* of noun or whatever,
just that the word is a noun.

These words could be stacked, so:

*kala* "fish / fishy, fish-like / to swim" (noun, adjective or verb -- idunno!)

*kala <adj>* "fishy"  
*kala <vrb>* "to swim"  
*kala <nun>* "(a) fish"  

*kala <adj> <nun>* "fishiness (the degree to which something is fishy, or the state of being fishy), fishness (the qualitie of being fish-like), fish-hood"  
*kala <adj> <vrb>* "to make something fishy"
*kala <adj> <vrb> <nun>* "the act of making something fishy"

*kala <vrb> <nun>* "swimming"

*kala <vrb> <adj>* "swimmy; of or related to swimming"
*kala <vrb> <adj> <nun>* "swimminess -- being related to swimming, or the degree to which something is swimmy"
*kala <nun> <vrb>* "doing something related to fish" you might think "fishing", but no -- that would be *awasa kala*.

The way I've described this so far is very anglocentric -- 
I need to double-check later whether this is actually the best set of words for these,
and if combining them in this way is actually internationally intuitive.

But for now, 6 rules emerge:

*noun* <verb> - doing something related to *noun*
*noun* <adje> - *noun*y; *noun*-like

verb <noun> *verb*ing; the act of *verb*ing
verb <adje> *verb*y; of or relating to *verb*

adj <noun> *adj*iness; the degree to which something is *adj*-like
adj <verb> *adj*ify; to make something *adj*-like


This is my preferred solution so far. I'll see if there's a chapter on embeddability (or recursion) in Pinker,
but unless he has any bright ideas (which is quite possible tbf) then I'll probably go with this.

### 4. Have each word only mean one very specific thing regardless of POS

here we remove a different problem, 
which might negate the need to solve this problem entirely:

the word *kala* would no longer mean either "fish" or "swim",
it would just mean "fish". Or just "swim". 

noun-phrases like *witan kala* would now **only** mean either "swimming clothes" or "fish clothes" (maybe fishing clothes?),
not both.

Again, I feel like this solution is sort of kicking the tin.
It only reduces the chance we'll encounter the root problem;
it doesn't remove it entirely.

Furthermore, it also creates a new problem:

if every word can only mean one thing (as any POS),
then we'll need a hecking lot more separate lexemes
for all these now-separate words.

This root-class system is apparently similar enough to Esperanto's that the same criticisms may apply:
from [http://jbr.me.uk/ranto/o.html]:
"
Class‐Switching – any given root can take any one of the endings, reducing the number of separate dictionary entries required: a verb can become an adjective, or a noun can become an adverb, without retaining any trace of its history.  (The more normal approach in natural languages is for class‐switching to involve adding some sort of extra suffix, so users can easily tell that for instance the noun goodness is derived from an adjective.)

Unfortunately… this radically artificial approach has unpleasant effects.  For a start, a single noun may be associated with more than one adjective – take for instance the roots dent‐, sun‐, viv‑.  As nouns they mean “tooth, sun, life”, but the adjectives are ambiguous in each case between “pertaining to” and “richly supplied with” the noun (“dental/toothy”, “solar/sunny”, “biotic/lively”).  Even when the class‐switching might work neatly, it often doesn't: for instance, nouns converted to verbs may end up either transitive (broso/brosi = “a brush/to brush”) or intransitive (fajro/fajri = “a fire/to be on fire”).  Compare also the haphazard behaviour of roots like timo = “fear” and naŭzo = “disgust”.
"

-----
[http://jbr.me.uk/ranto/n.html]:

"A genuinely Turkish‐style Esperanto would handle all the various modal, reflexive, conditional, or aspectual forms of verbs by stacking verb endings, so that (for instance) mi ne estos vidita = “I won't have been seen” would use perfect, passive, future, negative, and subject‐agreement endings to form something like, say, vid‐iv‐at‐ur‑en‑im. "

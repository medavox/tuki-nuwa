Unnamed Candidate Words
=======================

The strategy here is to freely add potential words for concepts I know Tuki Nuwa doesn't have a word for,
then later delete the word if I can create a decent equivalent phrase which means the same thing.

The hardest part of creating a new word is finding a good-sounding lexeme for it,
so that can be deferred until I know the word is definitely being added.

In the meantime, words without a lexeme will be referred to by a short version of their definition, in <angle brackets>.

### Key

symbol | meaning
-------|--------
++     | will definitely be included once I've decided on a lexeme.
+      | will probably be included, barring any new evidence or change of mind
?      | might be included; I'm on the fence/ not sure; undecided (possibly yet)
-      | might not be included; I've probably found a way to express the meaning of this word with a verbose phrase
--     | REALLY probably not going to add this.
adj    | adjective: describing word
sth    | something
sb     | someone/somebody

Grammar Words
-------------

Status:Notes | Usage (= POS) | Meaning
-------------|---------------|----------
+ | BE (SOMEONE/SOMETHING) kopula???
? probably this is a copula | *<word> <adj>* = to be <adj> | to have the property of the following adj phrase; to be <adj phrase>
+:iku | iku <adj> = become <adj>| to gain the property of the following adj phrase (by oneself); to become `<adj phrase>`, to get `<adj phrase>`; consider using kama (come to)
+ liki  | verb, liki <noun> = <noun>ly etc | adjective | previous word is an adjective/adverb; -y, -ly; in the manner of; like; LIKE~AS~WAY, similar to, in a similar manner to
nisa | *nisa <verb>* = the act of <verb>ing, <verb>tion; *nisa <adjective>* = <adj>ness, state of being <adj> | **next word or phrase is a noun**.
ula/sulu | <noun> ula <verb> = something which <verb>s, a <verb>er | makes the following verb-phrase a noun.
sa | sa <word> = verb | select verb meaning of next word
   | | select adjective meaning of next word
ends a noun-phrase

nisa might be unnecessary, as the position of the phrase in the sentence indicates whether a word is a noun\
it's not unnecessary, because nouns may be used as part of a phrase, where their POS is ambiguous

to Xify = jupa
to be Xified jupa X puha
to become X = iku

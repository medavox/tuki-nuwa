Unnamed Candidate Words
=======================

The strategy here is to freely add potential words for concepts I know Tuki Nuwa doesn't have a word for,
then later delete the word if I can create a decent equivalent phrase which means the same thing.

THe hardest part of creating a new word is finding a good-sounding lexeme for it,
so that can be deferred until I know the word is definitely being added.

In the meantime, words without a lexeme will be referred to by a short version of their definition, in <angle brackets>.

### Key

symbol | meaning
-------|--------
++     | will definitely be included once I've decided on a lexeme.
+      | will probably be included, barring any new evidence or change of mind
?      | might be included; I'm on the fence/ not sure; undecided (possibly yet)
-      | might not be included; I've probably found a way to express the meaning of this word with a verbose phrase
--     | REALLY probably not going to add this.
adj    | adjective: describing word
sth    | something
sb     | someone/somebody

Grammar Words

Status:Notes | Attaches to (POS) | results in (POS) | Meaning
-------------|-------------------|------------------|--------
? probably this is a copula | adj | verb | to have the property of the following adj phrase; to be <adj phrase>
+:iku | adj | verb | to gain the property of the following adj phrase (by oneself); to become `<adj phrase>`, to get `<adj phrase>`; consider using kama (come to)
+ liki  | verb, noun | adjective | previous word is an adjective/adverb; -y, -ly; in the manner of; like; LIKE~AS~WAY, similar to, in a similar manner to
+:nisa | verb, adjective | noun | next adj- or verb-phrase is a noun; "-ness"`<adj phrase>`-ness; state of being `<adj phrase>`; the act of doing `<verb phrase>`, `<verb phrase>`ing (as in cycling, fishing) `<verb phrase>`-ation. Goes before the affected phrase
ula | [`<noun>`] ula `<verb>`| noun phrase | (a `<noun>`that/sth which/sb who) `<verb>`s; a `<verb>`er; a `<verb>`ing `<noun>`. This word makes the following verb-phrase a noun. nisa can be used instead: ula + <verb> = <verb>er, something which <verb>s. But <noun> nisa + <verb> = a <verb>ing <noun>

nisa might be unecessary, as the position of the phrase in the sentence indicates whether a word is a noun
it's not unecessary, because nouns may be used as part of a phrase, where their POS is ambiguous

to Xify = jupa
to be Xified jupa X puha
to become X = iku

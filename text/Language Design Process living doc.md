I'm abandoning the idea of writing 3 tracks in parallel;
no more for-linguists, for-me, for-learners thing.

At least not yet.
I need to just write the thing first.
And the 3-tracks was an impediment to that.

Instead, I'll have 4 Major Sections:

Phonology,

Vocabulary,

Grammar,

Misc 

New Name and direction: The Little Language (of the Children of Rome?)

explicitly a eurolang, to improve communication inside the EU, and between the Americas
(also, one small language is a much easier target to learn for non-europeans wishing to trade etc)

choose words, phonology, syntax from an exclusively european-language set
(same rules as before - languages with more speakers get more votes, 1 million speakers = 1 vote)
see how many languages that is if we just remove the non-european languages from the current list
maybe pad or delete it to a round number if necessary

In order to break the deadlock,
WE'RE GOING TO ASSIGN INTERNATIONALISED LEXEMES AFTER PICKING ALL THE WORDS

1. decide on the inclusion of every word, party writing its dictionary entry while considering it
    words that aren't included should have a good explanation why not (with its replacement phrase or word),
    which can later be used as a English-to-Tokaja dictionary entry
    DO NOT PICK A LEXEME AT THIS STAGE: MERELY WHETHER THE MEANING SHOULD BE A WORD
2. partly in parallel, work on the syntax grammar of how to fit the words together

3. for all the content (not the glue grammar words, unless you can think of a good way to run them through the internationaliser),
    run them through the internationaliser to the most globally-familiar lexeme that is compatible with tokaja's phonology

Grammar design
=======

IF there is a finite set of choices for how a part of the grammar should be configued,
AND no choice is obviously the least complex, easiest to learn or easiest to use,
THEN check WALS to see what the chosen top 25 languages use, and design a system to use their number of speakers to choose the option that is most common

IF *that* also doesn't work for this grammatical choice, then do what English, IFF english is not unusual in this regard. Then do what Indonesian, Chinese, Spanish or Hindi does - in that order.


Dictionary Entries Design
=======

each word is now in its own text file, to provide space for:

discussion and justification (with suggested alternatives) of whether or not the word should be included,
and then (if so) a full, professional dictionary-like listing of its meanings,
how to use each one (esp incl transitivity info), and an example sentence

rather than backness.

* a is an open unrounded vowel
* e is a mid unrounded vowel
* i is a close unrounded vowel
* o is a close-mid, open-mid or open rounded vowel, 
  usually (but not always) more back
* u is a close rounded vowel, usually (but not always) more back

For English Speakers
-------------------

* a is pronounced as in p**a**n or f**a**ther
* e is pronounced as in p**e**n or p**ay**, never as in b**ee**n
* i is pronounced as in b**i**n or b**ee**n, never as in b**i**te
* o is pronounced as in l**o**t, b**o**ne or b**ore**
* u is pronounced as in s**oo**n or w**ou**ld, never as in **you**

We all vary our pronunciation of any language anyway,
when we whisper, speak with our mouth full, sing, or shout.

As long as you are understood, all is good -- *ale li pona*.

stress is always on the first syllable of each word.

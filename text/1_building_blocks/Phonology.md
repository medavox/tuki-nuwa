Their pronunciation should be fairly self-explanatory (if you read the latin alphabet),
but here are some example pronunciations anyway.
Remember, it doesn't matter too much *how* you pronounce them, 
as long as people can tell them apart.

Letter  | Pronunciation examples
--------|-----------------------
a 		| [a ɑ æ ɐ ]
e       | [e ɛ ]
i 		| [i y ɪ ]
o       | [o ɒ ɔ oʊ ]
u 		| [u ʊ  ]


vowels are more disinguished by closeness and roundedness,
rather than backness.

* a is an open unrounded vowel
* e is a mid unrounded vowel
* i is a close unrounded vowel
* o is a close-mid, open-mid or open rounded vowel, 
  usually (but not always) more back
* u is a close rounded vowel, usually (but not always) more back

For English Speakers
-------------------

Tokaja is quite forgiving in how you say each letter. 
Any of these pronunciations can be used for each letter, in any context:

* a as in p**a**n or f**a**ther
* e as in p**e**n or p**ay**, never as in b**ee**n
* i as in b**i**n or b**ee**n, never as in b**i**te
* j as in English **y**es, never as in **j**ab. This is the same as in German "**j**a" 
* k as in **k**ick or **g**et
* l as in **l**ove or the **r** in **r**un
* m as in **m**at
* n as in **n**ap
* o as in l**o**t, b**o**ne or b**ore**
* p as **p**an or the **b** in **b**an
* s as in **s**it or the **z** in **z**oo
* t as in **t**ap or the **d** in **d**og
* u as in s**oo**n or w**ou**ld, never as in **U**niversity
* v can be pronounced: 
    - like the **v** in **v**an
    - like the **w** in **w**et
    - or like the **f** in **f**an

You would probably pronounce it as **v** or **w** if you speak English as a first language; 
but not everyone can make these sounds.
So be forgiving of other accents, and
listen out for the other pronunciations from people whose first language isn't English!


We all vary our pronunciation of any language anyway,
when we whisper, speak with our mouth full, sing, or shout.

As long as you are understood, all is good -- *ale li pona*.

If you speak a language that stresses a particular syllable,
stress is always on the first syllable of each word.

1 undecided: brand new word ideas; not decided if including
2 including: definitely including. Probably no lexeme yet, or at best an untested one
3 unreprocessed: old dictionary entry, which may no longer fit language phono(logy/tactics)
4 now unpronounceable: old lexeme no longer fits phonology
5 to rescan: old lexeme still fits, but not yet reprocessed by new word-internationality since the development of IPA-Transcribers
6 finished: completely done, ready to appear in dictionary
7 discarded: not including, with a given reason

lexemes with markdown bold formatting **like this** have been produced by the word-internationality program, at some point

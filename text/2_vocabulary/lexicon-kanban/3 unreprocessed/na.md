na
===

Noun
---

precedes the indirect object (second object), in a sentence with a ditransitive verb.
Optional for clarity.

*lu li pana e lu na siki* - "he gives her the ball"

*lu li pana e lu sama na pima numa mani* he gives himself 5 coins

----

distinguishing direct and indirect objects makes the language a lot harder for speakers of languages that don't make this distinction;
consider another way?

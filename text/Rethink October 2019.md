I'm abandoning the idea of writing 3 tracks in parallel;
no more for-linguists, for-me, for-learners thing.

At least not yet.
I need to just write the thing first.
And the 3-tracks was an impediment to that.

Instead, I'll have 4 Major Sections:

Phonology,

Vocabulary,

Grammar,

Misc 

In order to break the deadlock with grammar work,
I'm going to adopt a good-enough strategy for creating new lexemes:

either:

I'll just pick a relevant English word, 
and filter it through this language's phonology system.
I can also just choose a sound I like,
because both approaches are equally unscientific,
and intended to be replaced.

or:

I'll use a subset of the languages in IPA-transcribers,
to produce a word that is international for, say, the top 7 languages.

The goal is to be able to continue adding words, and working on the grammar of the language.

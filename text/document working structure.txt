for each part of the language,
have a document that is official (for external use), 
and a document discussing possible additions (for me:  like a wiki's talk page)

the parts of the language:

alphabet, sounds & pronunciation (basically done)
dictionary/word list
general grammar of the language
numbers
grammar for specific words & constructions
conceptual metaphors used
vocab sets (subsets of the main dictionary)
    body parts


change the landing page for new ideas from 'new words' to 'how to say'

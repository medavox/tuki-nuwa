Lesson 1: Introduction
=====

Alu!

I'm glad you've decided to give these lessons a look. Hopefully
this introduction will answer any questions you may have. If you're
thinking about learning Tuki Nuwa, hopefully this introduction will also
give you a feel for what lies ahead.

If you're like me, as you learn Tuki Nuwa you may find that the frame of
mind that Tuki Nuwa relies upon sometimes conflicts with how you've
always approached understanding things. It's not so easy to adopt the
way of thinking that Tuki Nuwa requires. But be patient; eventually,
even if you don't agree with the ideas behind Tuki Nuwa, it will at
least broaden your mind and help you understand things better.

You should now be able to decide whether or not you'd like to learn Toki
Pona. A last word of advice: Don't feel like you're alone in learning
the language. I've helped others learn the language in the past
([Contact me!](contact.php)), and there are plenty of other people
willing to explain tough concepts and give advice.

With that said, enjoy the lessons, and good luck learning Tuki Nuwa!

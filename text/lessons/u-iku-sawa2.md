Lesson 2: Alphabet and Pronunciation
======


There are fourteen letters in the Toki Pona alphabet: nine consonants (j
k l m n p s t w) and three vowels (a e i o u).

```
a h i j k l m n p s t u w
```

Each letter only ever makes one sound, but how you pronounce that sound is up to you.




Consonants
-----

There are 10 consonants in Tuki Nuwa. 

Toki Nawa allows a lot of flexibility in pronunciation; 
as long as you make yourself understood, `ali li puna`!

Except for j, all the consonants are pronounced like in English.

letter  | pronounced like in
--------|--------------------
h       | **h**at
j       | **y**et
k       | **k**ill
l       | **l**et
m       | **m**et
n       | **n**et
p       | **p**it
s       | **s**ink
t       | **t**oo
w       | **w**et

As you may have noticed, Tuki Nuwa's j isn't pronounced like English's
j. Instead, always pronounce it like the letter *y* in English. Some
languages (e.g., German and Esperanto) also pronounce j this way, but if
you've never studied such languages, be careful to pronounce it right.
If you see j, pretend it's *y*.

Vowels
----

In English, vowels are pronounced many different ways depending on the
word. In Tuki Nuwa, though, the vowels are all regular and never change
pronunciation.

If you're familiar with Spanish, Italian, or Esperanto, you'll recognize
that Toki Pona's vowels are the same as in those languages. Study this
chart:

  -------- --------------------

  a        f**a**ther
  i        p**ee**l
  u        f**oo**d

Now that you've learned the alphabet, check out this neat little picture
by Nikitia Ayzikovsky, an early Toki Pona speaker. It shows fourteen
different Toki Pona words, each beginning with a different letter from
the Toki Pona alphabet, and there's also a picture of what each word
represents. (Note that Elena \[Greek\] is an unofficial word. When this
graphic was made, Toki Pona had no nouns beginning with the letter e.)

More Advanced Stuff

As long as you've mastered the above material, you know everything you
need to continue learning basic Toki Pona. If learning the alphabet and
pronunciation was easy for you and if you feel confident, go ahead and
read the rest of this lesson now. However, if you had a difficult time
with the above material, just focus on it for now, and return to finish
this lesson at a later time. (The information is still important if you
hope to master Toki Pona, so come back to it later.)

There are a few more things to learn about Toki Pona pronunciation and
style:

Toki Pona words don't need to be capitalized, even at the beginning of 
a sentence!
Capitalise them if you want to, but know that *there is no wrong way
to capitalise Tuki Nuwa*.

I choose to capitalise the name of the language.

Capitalize unofficial words (i.e., the names of people, places,
religions, etc.) A few examples:\
jan Susan li pona. = Susan is good. (Susan, a person's name, is the only
word capitalized in this sentence.)\
ma Elopa li suli. = Europe is big. (Europe isn't one of Toki Pona's 120
official words, so it's capitalized.)

Because Toki Pona has so few consonants, you have some flexibility with
pronouncing them. In addition to the pronunciations you learned above,
here's a quick list of some of the alternate pronunciations that certain
consonants can have:

  -------- --------------------
  letter   pronounced like in
  p        **b**it
  t        **d**og
  k        **g**arden
  s        zoo
  -------- --------------------

Toki Pona's syllables all follow a pattern: consonant + vowel + optional
n. If a syllable is at the beginning of a word, the consonant is
optional. (For example, ali and unpa don't begin with consonants.) The
optional n is forbidden if the next syllable begins with m or n. Four
combinations are forbidden due to difficulty hearing and/or saying them;
these are: ji, ti, wo, and wu.

Accent is always on the first syllable.

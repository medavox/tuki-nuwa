Sentences with mi or sina as the subject
----

One of the first principles you'll need to learn about Toki Pona is that
it has no form of the verb to be. For example:\
mi pona. I am good.\
sina suli. You are big/important.\
Simply state mi or sina, then complete the sentence with an adjective or
verb. Although the lack of to be may seem odd and discomforting, it's
actually simpler if you think about it, and there are other languages
that don't use to be. Just practice until you get accustomed to the
idea.

Toki Pona Is Often Ambiguous
-----

While reading the vocabulary section at the top of the page, you
probably noticed that several words have multiple meanings. suli, for
example, can mean either long or tall... or big... or important. You may
be wondering how one word mean so many different things, but truthfully,
*many* Toki Pona words have multiple meanings. With such a tiny
vocabulary, ambiguity is inevitable but not necessarily bad: The
vagueness forces you to focus on very basic, core features instead of
lots of tiny, often frivolous details.

Toki Pona's vocabulary is also ambiguous because it doesn't let you
specify whether a word is singular or plural. For example, jan can mean
either person or people. (Side note: Japanese is the same way.) You'll
eventually learn a way to distinguish singular versus plural, but not in
this lesson.

The "Verb"
-----

Look over these examples:\
mi moku. I eat. **or** I am food.\
sina pona. You are good. **or** You fix.\
These sentences illustrate Toki Pona's ambiguity yet again. Because Toki
Pona lacks to be, the exact meaning is lost. In this sentence, moku
could be either a verb or a noun. Likewise, pona could be either an
adjective or a verb. In these situations, the listener/reader must rely
on context. After all, how often do you hear someone say I am food? I
hope not very often! You can be fairly certain that mi moku means I'm
eating. For sentences like sina pona, there is a way to help you clarify
the intended meaning, but you'll learn about that in the next lesson.

No Verb Tenses
-----

Toki Pona's "verbs" have no tense.\
mi pona. I am good. **or** I was good. **or** I will be good.\
This is yet another example of the vagueness inherent in Toki Pona. If
absolutely necessary, there's a way to specify when something happened,
but you won't learn about that until [lesson 17](okamasona17.php).

Sentences without mi or sina as the subject
-----

We've already looked at mi and sina sentences, which are the simplest
sentences possible in Toki Pona. For sentences that don't use mi or sina
as the subject, there is one small difference you'll need to learn. Look
at how li is used:\
telo li pona. Water is good.\
suno li suli. The sun is big.\
moku li pona. Eating/food is good.

li is a grammatical word that separates the subject from its "verb."
Remember: Always use li if the subject isn't mi or sina, and never use
it if the subject is mi or sina. Although li might seem cumbersome and
worthless now, as you continue to learn Toki Pona you'll see that some
sentences could be very confusing if li weren't there, so practice using
it until it becomes normal to you.

Practice
====

Try translating these sentences from English to Toki Pona.\

People are good.
Check your answer:jan li pona.

Check your answer:mi moku.
You're tall.
Check your answer:sina suli.
Water is simple.
Check your answer:telo li pona.

And now try changing these sentences from Toki Pona into English:\

mi suli.
Check your answer:I'm important.  OR  I'm fat.
jan li moku.

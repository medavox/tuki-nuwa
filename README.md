"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler"

-Albert Einstein


Toki Nuwa is a language designed to be simple to learn.
It achieves this by making each of its words sound familiar to *the most people possible*.

It only has around 360 words.
Concepts which would be expressed in a single word in other languages,
are expressed in Toki Nuwa with a phrase. 
Unnecessary details are left out, but can be added with further phrases.

The collection of letters/sounds (the "word-form") to represent a given concept is chosen by what would be recognisable to the most people globally.
Each word has been translated into the top 20 or so most widely-spoken languages, and the word-form that:

1. occurs for the most people, while
2. being recognisable when converted to toki nuwa's phonology

is chosen.

This is not necessarily always the word from a single language with many speakers.
due to the shared history of some languages, 
and also due to cultural cross-pollination (both in our modern world and historically),
many languages with relatively fewer speakers individually may collectively have enough speakers to "out-vote"
other language(s) with more speakers.

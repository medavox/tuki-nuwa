"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler"

-Albert Einstein


Tokaja is a spoken language designed to be simple to learn.
It achieves this by making each of its words sound familiar to *the most people possible*.

It only has around 360 words.
Concepts which would be expressed in a single word in other languages,
are expressed in Tokaja with a phrase. 
Unnecessary details are left out, but can be added with further phrases.

The collection of letters/sounds (the "word-form") to represent a given concept is chosen by what would be recognisable to the most people globally.
Each word has been translated into the top 20 or so most widely-spoken languages, and the word-form that:

1. occurs for the most people, while
2. being recognisable when converted to Tokaja's phonology

is chosen.

This is not necessarily always the word from a single language with many speakers.
due to the shared history of some languages, 
and also due to cultural cross-pollination (both in our modern world and historically),
many languages with relatively fewer speakers individually may collectively have enough speakers to "out-vote"
other language(s) with more speakers.

Tokaja is a  language that aims to be as easy to learn as possible, for as many people as possible.
It does this with the following design:

* **Accessible Phonology**: Tokaja only has 13 sounds, each of which almost everyone already knows how to pronounce
* **Small Lexicon** Tokaja only has a total of 360 words in it; few enough to remember, many enough to express fine distinctions and concepts
* **Small grammar** a relatively simple, well-defined grammar. No conjugation!
* **Recognisable vocabulary for many**: most word-forms (how they're spelled and spoken) are recognisable to the most number of people possible, by comparing the word in the top-25 most spoken lnaugages across the world.
